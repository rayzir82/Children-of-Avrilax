# The World of Avrilax #

Death is not a natural part of the "life" cycle on Avrilax and never has been.  

There is no illness, disease, or old age.  

If a living thing has a point where it reaches maturity, it is at this point that that creature also stops aging.

If a living thing continues to grow until it dies, then it continues to grow until it is killed.

Neglecting ones health can still kill you.  You can still starve or die of a heart attack or bleed to death.

Death is final.  Once a creature dies there is no resurrecting it as it was.  In most cultures, upon death bodies are burned on the bare ground.  An undiscovered body will decay on its own.

Avrilax is populated by the same types of creatures as Earth is and those creatures are very similar to how they are on Earth.  There also just happens to be a great many more than just those from Earth.

As a whole, the different races have certain tendencies, but there are brutal humans, just as there are civilized orks.  There are genius goblins and dragons of less than average intelligence.  There are above and below average members of every race.

There are no gods on Avrilax.  Some cultures around the world do worship things of a Pagan nature, which is more paying homage to your planet and respecting nature, but there are no entities in the "heavens" ruling over the world.

# Children of Avrilax #

Avrilax is a deity as well as a planet.  It does not interfere with the life that exists on it, in any way.

People don't procreate on Avrilax to have children, only for their own amusement.  The planet produces new children and everyone helps raise them and look after them.

The planet created every race and it doesn't see any of them as bad, just different.

Man learned arcane magic, it was not given.  This means that all Arcane casters are of a single type and only vary in what they have chosen to learn.

Given that there are no gods vying for prayers/followers, there is no divine magic.

# Story #

Some time ago people discovered magic and Wizardry (Name?) was born.

As time goes on wizards get better and better and became more and more common.  After a time they founded a great library to study and expand their knowledge in one place.  As time went on a city, called (not named yet) was founded around this great library.

Since any person can learn to use magic, there are those who learn it on their own in the wilds of the world.  There are also those that learn it in the great library and seek to do harm or control others with it.

Born from the need to stop those that would use magic to harm others, the Hunters are born.

Though they started as Wizards, they are something different now.  They rarely cast spells in any outward way.  In essence, they were taught to internalize most of their magic.  They can sense a magic user that is near them and in which direction they lie.  They have a protective layer of magic just outside their skin that stops all magic from effecting them directly.  Their outward facing spells appear mostly in the form of summoned weapons, with one or two very specific spells thrown in for utility.

The ability to reanimate dead tissue was discovered next, Necromancy (name?) is born.  

The general populace catching these Necromancers at their grisly work led to the creation of "hanging" someone.  To peacefully avoid further persecution, Necromancers gathered en mass and built a city (not named yet).  

In this city they discovered that if the dead are interred and kept from direct contact with the planet that they don't decompose as fast.

Initially there were tales of them stealing people to keep until they died so that they had more bodies...  Or that the city was a dark and evil place.....  Neither was the case.  Necromancers aren't even evil, they just use magic in a way that most find distasteful.

Necromancers discovered that with the creation of the city that the planet provided a birth place for them as well, just like any other city.  The city is a very cultured place and enjoys much laughter.  The only difference is that they inter their dead.  Their lives are like any others on Avrilax though.

Some Wizards decided that they would not stand for the dead being treated the way that they were being treated by the Necromancers.  They taught themselves to sever the magical connection animating corpses.  These Wizards also spent more time than other Wizards learning the arts of war, fighting with weapons and wearing armor.

They were specialist Wizards and called themselves Clerics (Name?)

Necromancers and Clerics spent twenty years nipping at each others heals in every part of the world.  During these conflicts it was discovered that each casters own special brand of magic could effect the other in a way that neither had suspected.  Necromancer magic could be used to injure the living, raise and inspire the dead.  Clerical magic could be used to heal the living, Sever the Necromancers hold on a corpse and cause undead to cower in fear.

These, sometimes public, clashes between Necromancers and Clerics became a part of the way things were for for those twenty years.  

# Geography #

Avrilax mostly consists of land mass of various types (deserts, swamps, mountains, etc.) with 3 major inland seas and a huge number of lakes with rivers throughout the land.  There are forests both beautiful and dark.  There are mountains that reach high and caverns deep.  There are vast deserts and seas that will leave you with no land in sight.  There are grassy plains and treacherous swamps.  Avrilax is a place of both wonder and terror.

The fact that Avrilax is more land than water means that there is less cloud cover and the further you get between the seas the less storms and cloud cover there will be.

The axis of Avrilax is tilted, like Earth's own, meaning that there are seasons on Avrilax.

I will draw up a map of the world and post it here for all to see, I'm still working on that though.
